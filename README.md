##My config
"config" is stuff from my .config file 
scripts are scripts that are used in my window managers configs (also includes my dwm and openbox opening script for sddm)
Hyprland-split-workspace is a config if I want to use the split-workspaces plugin for hyprland
Xresources and xinitrc are as they say, my .Xresources and .xinitrc
